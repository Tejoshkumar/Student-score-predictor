# 🎯 Student Score Predictor using Linear Regression

This project uses a *simple machine learning model* to predict student scores based on the number of hours they studied. It's built using *Python, **pandas, **scikit-learn, and **matplotlib*.

## 📊 Problem Statement
Given a dataset containing student study hours and corresponding exam scores, build a model that predicts *score based on study time*.

## 💡 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Google Colab (or Kaggle)

## 📁 Dataset
- [student_scores.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdiPersonalWorks/Random/master/student_scores%20-%20student_scores.csv)
- Contains two columns: Hours and Scores

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. Loaded the dataset using pandas
2. Visualized the data using matplotlib (scatter plot)
3. Trained a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn
4. Predicted the score for a student who studied 9.25 hours
5. Evaluated and visualized the prediction
